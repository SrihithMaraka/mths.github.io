                  <p style="text-indent: 5em;">The world we live in is advancing very quickly, from small technologies in genetics to drones in the film industry. UASs are becoming very popular and many consumers are buying them. These drones can be flown by anyone and the easy use makes more people want to buy them. This new technology is used in many different fields such as films or archelogy. </p>
                  <p style="text-indent: 5em;">The objective for our group was to create a website about drones that would demonstrate our ability to create an elegant and functional design without using templates. We used our knowledge of HTML5 and CSS in order to code the website. Before the initial design of the website we came up with some preconceived ideas and the basic blueprint for how the site would be laid out. After collaborating and debate amongst the team, we finalized the design that we wanted to use. The group met at our local library whenever we could to work on coding the website. We made it our goal to meet at least once a week and we easily accomplished the goal by meeting twice a week several times. The first few weeks were the most challenging as no one in our group had ever created a fully functional website of the caliber we originally set out to design. We all used the knowledge we gained from taking AP Computer Science, although that course was almost entirely based on Java. We spent most of the first few weeks doing research and watching seminars from some of the best website designers in the business. We had borrowed several books from our library on HTML5 and CSS. After reading those books, we started to plan the outline for the website.
For the scope of the project, we needed a few materials. We each needed a laptop and we wanted them all to be running Windows 10, to ensure there wouldn’t be any incompatibility amongst the software we would be running. We used Github to be able to collaborate and have different revisions of the website we could revert to in the event of errors. Atom text editor was used as it offered the easiest way to focus on coding without having many distractions and unnecessary components, it also had the benefit of easily integrating with Github. Gimp was our image editor of choice due to its zero dollar cost and utilitarian design that offered many tools and ways to modify images. We also used sketch paper to design the initial blueprint before we started coding.
Every piece of the website has its purpose for existence. We wanted to ensure that everything had a meaningful contribution to the overall design and presentation of the website. The blueprint constituted the layout which included the font style, size, and color, with the configuration of tabs, and the placement of images. We really wanted to focus on having the website present information in an elegant, easy to view manner that would indulge the reader into continuing to browse and explore. In order to accomplish this we spent a lot of time reviewing how each piece of the website added something meaningful. We also spent a lot of time looking into other popular websites and the methods they use to keep readers interested and intrigued. We asked our TSA chapter members of their favorite websites and incorporated their opinions into the final build of the website.
