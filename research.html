                <p>One example is researching nuclear accidents. Equipment can be attached to drones that allow them to monitor the radiation level of the surrounding area. They can be used in glaciers to measure the melting of the ice caps. This information could then be used to evacuate the area before an avalanche occurs.</p>

              <p>They can be flown over volcanoes to capture footage and gather information on lava flow and eruptions. It is estimated that we have yet to discover 86% of the species on earth. We can use drones to explore areas that were previously inaccessible or difficult for exploring. Canyons or caves are such examples of difficult to explore areas. The Kola Superdeep Borehole is the deepest artificial crater, humans cannot descend to the bottom due to the extreme heat from the liquid outer core. </font></p></B></i>

                <p>Monitoring trees in forests is difficult due to the large variety of different species. Each behaves in its own unique way. Through the use of drones, checking for disease amongst trees is much easier and intuitive. Traditionally an ecologist would need to check each individual tree in a forest, and he is bound to miss several trees along his journey.There are also many different sizes of drones. For example, there is the micro drone which has a built in camera and can travel in small spaces, unlike a regular sized drone or a human. These drones can through the pyramids in Mexico and explore them to see if they are same for humans to go through. Also, these micro drones can map the pyramids, so when archaeologists go into the pyramid, they know where they are going.</font></p>
