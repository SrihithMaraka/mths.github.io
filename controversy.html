                  With the advent of drones in the consumer market, it is apparent that there is a concern regarding privacy and security. Drones can be equipped with sensors such as cameras and microphones, which could capture sensitive information. With the growth of digital security concerns in commonplace society, any form of digital communication must be properly monitored. Wireless communications themselves were a concern when they were first developed, as there was the possibility of data interception. Drones can function as an extension of this danger - they can physically move their sensors over barriers by free-flying and in a sense “break physical barriers” unlike before. Data interception essentially becomes physical again with drones, and the combination of physical movement and wireless communication in a single device can cause a breach of privacy.

<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
  The possibility of using drones as a physical weapon is also another concern for society. arming A recent YouTube video showed a modified drone fitted with a semi-automatic handgun shooting into trees. The video prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  to investigate, though the reasoning for this investigation is not known. As drone technology advances, there is more than cameras that can be equipped. The capability for dangerous weaponry to be carried on a free-flying device is a concern that needs regulations before mainstream production, and the tree incident was not the only time weaponry had been used on a drone. In May 2015, a man was arrested for flying a drone over the White House fence, which nevertheless the unusuality of the situation, raised some red flags in regards to safety. Keeping in mind with what the potential of drones are, basic standards have been developed by the FAA.


</p>
<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
  The FAA ordered that all drones must fly below 400 feet; they must also be kept within visual line of sight at all times. In addition, drones are not allowed to be flown within 5 miles of airports unless consent from the airport and control tower is received. This is just a small piece of the official FAA regulations regarding the flying of consumer drones.
